Quartus-II-Altera-FPGA
======================

This is not a branch off of Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner because 
the direction of this project may not match with the main project.

The first goal is to master the use of the Altera Cyclone IV for the 
purpose of mining bitcoins.

The second goal is to setup the Quartus project and the mining app to be clearly
mapped out so that building an new bitstream for any altera device is easy.

This was taken from: 
Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner / projects / VHDL_StratixIV_OrphanedGland /


This project is being modified using Quartus II 12.1sp1 (64-Bit) Full Version
